## Pre-requisites
- 7 x Jumper Wires
- 1 x Arduino Uno
- 1 x Breadboard
- 1 x 5mm LED: Red
- 1 x 5mm LED: Green
- 1 x 5mm LED: Yellow

## Setup and Build Plan
Connecting the components:
- Hook the GND pin (Negative pin, the shorter pin) of all LED to pin GND of Arduino.
- Connect Red LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin, the longer pin) to Pin 9 of Arduino.
- Connect Yellow LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin,the longer pin) to Pin 8 of Arduino.
- Connect Green LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin, the longer pin) to Pin 7 of Arduino

Setup:
-Download/copy the code from the code folder
-Upload/paste the code in the Arduion IDE
-Connect your computer to Arduino Uno and upload the code
