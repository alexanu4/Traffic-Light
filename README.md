# Traffic Light
A simple yet effective Arduino project that simulates the functionality of a real traffic light system. The project uses an Arduino Uno, a breadboard, and three LEDs (red, yellow, and green) to replicate the behavior of a standard traffic signal. The goal is to demonstrate basic circuit design and Arduino programming, making it an excellent learning project for beginners in electronics and embedded systems.
This project is based on: https://projecthub.arduino.cc/krishna_agarwal/traffic-light-using-arduino-a-beginner-project-35f8c6#section5

## Pre-requisites
- 7 x Jumper Wires
- 1 x Arduino Uno
- 1 x Breadboard
- 1 x 5mm LED: Red
- 1 x 5mm LED: Green
- 1 x 5mm LED: Yellow

## Setup and Build Plan
Connecting the components:
- Hook the GND pin (Negative pin, the shorter pin) of all LED to pin GND of Arduino.
- Connect Red LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin, the longer pin) to Pin 9 of Arduino.
- Connect Yellow LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin,the longer pin) to Pin 8 of Arduino.
- Connect Green LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin, the longer pin) to Pin 7 of Arduino

Setup:
- Download/copy the code from the code folder
- Upload/paste the code in the Arduion IDE
- Connect your computer to Arduino Uno and upload the code
